# Health & Metrics

Two endpoints expose every observable signal SimDeck collects: `GET /api/health` for the bootstrap surface and `GET /api/metrics` for the running counters.

## `GET /api/health`

Returns the static bootstrap information the browser client needs, plus a freshness timestamp.

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "httpPort": 4310,
  "timestamp": 1714094761.234,
  "videoCodec": "h264-software",
  "lowLatency": false,
  "webRtc": {
    "iceServers": [{ "urls": ["stun:stun.l.google.com:19302"] }],
    "iceTransportPolicy": "all"
  }
}
```

| Field                       | Notes                                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ok`                        | Always `true` if the route is reachable. Network failures are signalled by HTTP errors.   |
| `httpPort`                  | HTTP port for the REST API, browser UI, and WebRTC offer endpoint.                        |
| `timestamp`                 | Server-side `time.now()` as a fractional Unix epoch in seconds.                           |
| `videoCodec`                | Active encoder. One of `h264` or `h264-software`. See [Video Pipeline](/guide/video).     |
| `lowLatency`                | `true` when software H.264 low-latency mode was enabled at daemon startup.                |
| `realtimeStream`            | `true` when the WebRTC stream is configured to favor freshness and realtime pacing.       |
| `streamQuality`             | Active realtime quality profile and encoder limits such as `maxEdge`, `fps`, and bitrate. |
| `webRtc.iceServers`         | ICE servers the browser should use when creating the WebRTC peer connection.              |
| `webRtc.iceTransportPolicy` | Browser ICE transport policy. One of `all` or `relay`.                                    |

The default access token is regenerated every time the server restarts. A client should refetch `/api/health` after any disconnection.

## `GET /api/metrics`

Returns a snapshot of every server-side counter and the rolling buffer of client-reported stats:

```json
{
  "frames_encoded": 12039,
  "keyframes_encoded": 17,
  "frames_sent": 11982,
  "frames_dropped_server": 21,

  "active_streams": 1,
  "subscribers_connected": 3,
  "subscribers_disconnected": 2,
  "avg_send_queue_depth": 0.91,

  "latest_first_frame_ms": 412,
  "client_streams": [
    {
      "clientId": "browser-ABC",
      "kind": "viewport",

    }
  ]
}
```

### Counter glossary

| Counter                    | Increments when…                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `frames_encoded`           | The native bridge produces a frame.                                                     |
| `keyframes_encoded`        | The encoder emits a keyframe (always a subset of `frames_encoded`).                     |
| `frames_sent`              | A frame is written to a WebRTC client.                                                  |
| `frames_dropped_server`    | A client is too slow and the broadcast channel skips frames for them.                   |
| `keyframe_requests`        | The transport hub asks the encoder for a fresh keyframe (e.g. on reconnect or refresh). |
| `active_streams`           | Currently open WebRTC streams.                                                          |
| `subscribers_connected`    | Lifetime count of WebRTC streams opened.                                                |
| `subscribers_disconnected` | Lifetime count of WebRTC streams closed.                                                |
| `avg_send_queue_depth`     | Running average of broadcast channel pressure.                                          |
| `max_send_queue_depth`     | Peak broadcast channel pressure.                                                        |
| `latest_first_frame_ms`    | First-frame latency for the most recent connect, in milliseconds.                       |

### Client stream stats

`client_streams` is a rolling buffer of the most recent reports a client posted to `POST /api/client-stream-stats`. The server keeps the last 48 entries per `(clientId, kind)` pair.

The browser client uses these to render its in-app diagnostics overlay and to size its decoder workers. Every field is optional except `clientId` and `kind`; see [`ClientStreamStats`](https://github.com/NativeScript/SimDeck/blob/main/server/src/metrics/counters.rs) for the full schema.

## Submitting client stats

```http
POST /api/client-stream-stats
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "clientId": "browser-ABC",
  "kind": "viewport",
  "udid": "9D7E5BB7-...",
  "codec": "h264",
  "width": 1170,
  "height": 2532,
  "decodedFps": 59.7,
  "droppedFps": 0.0,
  "latestRenderMs": 6.2
}
```

Required fields:

- `clientId` — any stable identifier you pick.
- `kind` — what slice of the client is reporting (`viewport`, `decoder`, `renderer`, …).

Anything else is optional but typed; unknown fields are rejected.

A successful submission returns:

```json
{ "ok": true }
```

## `GET /api/client-stream-stats`

Returns the same `clientStreams` array that `GET /api/metrics` includes, in case you only want the client-side view:

```json
{ "clientStreams": [ ... ] }
```
