# Video Pipeline

SimDeck streams the iOS Simulator over WebRTC using browser-native H.264 video playout. This page walks through the encoder choices, the keyframe handshake, and the metrics you can use to tune them.

## Codec selection

The server can encode the simulator display in two modes, picked at startup with `--video-codec`:

| Value                       | Encoder                         | When to use it                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `h264`                      | Hardware H.264 via VideoToolbox | Best local performance when the hardware encoder is available. |
| `h264-software` _(default)_ | Software H.264 via VideoToolbox | Compatibility fallback when hardware encode is unavailable.    |

Restart the daemon to change encoder mode:

```sh
simdeck daemon restart --video-codec h264-software
```

For slower runners, add `--low-latency` with software H.264:

```sh
simdeck daemon start --video-codec h264-software --low-latency
```

Low-latency mode caps software H.264 at 15 fps, keeps a single in-flight frame,
scales the longest edge to 1170 pixels, and backs off FPS more aggressively when
encode pressure rises. WebRTC refresh pacing uses the same 15 fps floor so the
server does not keep waking capture/encode faster than the stream can consume.
It is CLI-only because it is meant for less capable machines where freshness
matters more than maximum smoothness.

The chosen codec is reported to clients in the JSON `videoCodec` field on `GET /api/health`.

## Keyframe handshake

When a browser connects through `/api/simulators/{udid}/webrtc/offer`:

1. The server ensures the `SimulatorSession` is started and asks the encoder for an immediate refresh.
2. It waits up to 3 seconds for the next keyframe.
3. As soon as a keyframe arrives, it answers the browser's SDP offer and starts writing H.264 samples to a WebRTC video track.
4. Subsequent frames stream until the peer connection closes.

If the encoder cannot deliver a keyframe within 3 seconds, the server tears the session down with a clear error so the client can retry. This usually happens only when CoreSimulator is itself stuck.

## Drop and lag handling

The transport hub uses a tokio broadcast channel to fan out frames. If a slow client misses frames the hub:

1. Increments `frames_dropped_server` on the metrics counter.
2. Sets a "waiting for keyframe" flag and skips non-keyframes until a fresh one arrives.
3. Calls `request_refresh()` on the session so the encoder forces a keyframe.

The WebRTC path favors freshness: stale frames are dropped and the sender requests a new keyframe after discontinuities.

## Picking a codec

A few practical guidelines:

- **Start on the default for compatibility.** `h264-software` works without requiring the hardware encoder, but full-resolution latency can be high.
- **Switch to `h264` on local Apple Silicon when hardware encode is available.** Hardware H.264 gives the smoothest local preview with the least CPU.
- **Switch to `h264-software` when the hardware encoder stalls or is unavailable.** The encoder scales the longest edge to 1600 pixels, can climb toward 60 fps, and backs off dynamically under encode latency.
- **Use `h264-software --low-latency` on virtualized CI Macs when hardware encode is unavailable.** This profile caps at 15 fps, uses a single pending frame, reduces the longest edge to 1170 pixels, and backs off before software encode latency turns into seconds of stream delay.

## Tuning with metrics

`GET /api/metrics` returns a snapshot of every counter the server keeps:

```json
{
  "frames_encoded": 12039,
  "keyframes_encoded": 17,
  "frames_sent": 11982,
  "frames_dropped_server": 21,
  "keyframe_requests": 4,
  "active_streams": 1,
  "subscribers_connected": 3,
  "subscribers_disconnected": 2,
  "max_send_queue_depth": 1,
  "latest_first_frame_ms": 412
}
```

Useful signals:

| Counter                 | What to look at                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `latest_first_frame_ms` | First-frame latency for the most recent connect. Should be a few hundred ms.      |
| `frames_dropped_server` | If this climbs while a stream is open, the client cannot keep up.                 |
| `keyframe_requests`     | Goes up every time the server forces a refresh. Frequent spikes mean rough seeks. |
| `active_streams`        | Number of WebRTC streams currently subscribed.                                    |

Clients can also push their decoder/renderer stats back to the server:

```http
POST /api/client-stream-stats
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "clientId": "browser-ABC",
  "kind": "viewport",
  "codec": "h264",
  "decodedFps": 59.7,
  "droppedFps": 0.1,
  "latestRenderMs": 6.2
}
```

The server keeps the last 48 entries per `(clientId, kind)` pair and returns them from `GET /api/client-stream-stats`. The browser client uses these to render the in-app diagnostics overlay.

## Refreshing a stuck stream

If a client suspects it has fallen too far behind, it can call:

```http
POST /api/simulators/{udid}/refresh
```

The server starts the session if needed and asks the encoder to emit a keyframe immediately. The browser client wires this to a "Refresh stream" affordance in its toolbar.
