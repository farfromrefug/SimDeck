# Service

SimDeck runs one local service. The service owns the browser UI, REST API, live
stream, inspector connections, and warm device sessions.

Most commands start or reuse the service automatically. Use the lifecycle
commands only when you need to inspect, stop, or restart it explicitly.

## Start

```sh
simdeck
simdeck --open
simdeck -p 4311
```

`simdeck` starts or reuses the background service and prints the browser URLs.
`--open` opens the local browser URL. `-p` or `--port` selects a non-default
port; the default is `4310`.

When that port is already used by a SimDeck service from another binary,
`simdeck` leaves it running and uses the next available port. This keeps source
checkout builds fast without touching your installed service.

## Autostart

```sh
simdeck -a
simdeck --autostart
simdeck pair
```

Without `-a`, SimDeck starts an ordinary background service for the current user
session. `-a`, `--autostart`, and `simdeck pair` install or refresh the macOS
LaunchAgent so SimDeck starts again after login.

`simdeck pair` also detects LAN and Tailscale addresses, prints the pairing
code, and renders the QR/deep link for the native iOS app.

## Manage

```sh
simdeck service status
simdeck service stop
simdeck service kill
simdeck service killall
simdeck service restart
simdeck service reset
simdeck service off
```

`service status`, `service stop`, and `service restart` manage the same singleton
service that `simdeck` uses. `service reset` rotates the LaunchAgent token and
pairing code. `service off` removes the LaunchAgent. `service kill` and
`service killall` stop every SimDeck service process they can find, including
services started by another SimDeck binary.
When `service restart` is run without `--port`, it keeps the installed
LaunchAgent port or the current singleton service port before falling back to
`4310`.

## Options

These options are accepted by `simdeck`, `service start`, `service restart`,
`service on`, and `service reset`:

| Flag                         | Default     | Use it when                                |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `--port <port>` / `-p`       | `4310`      | You want a specific service port           |
| `--bind <ip>`                | `127.0.0.1` | You need LAN access with `0.0.0.0` or `::` |
| `--advertise-host <host>`    | detected    | Remote browsers need a specific host or IP |
| `--video-codec <mode>`       | `auto`      | You need to force encoder behavior         |
| `--stream-quality <profile>` | `full`      | You want lower CPU or bandwidth use        |
| `--local-stream-fps <fps>`   | `60`        | You want a different local stream target   |
| `--client-root <path>`       | bundled UI  | You are serving a custom static client     |

## Restart CoreSimulator

If `simctl` hangs, reports a stale service version, or devices never attach:

```sh
simdeck core-simulator restart
```

Then retry:

```sh
simdeck list
simdeck boot <udid>
```
