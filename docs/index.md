## What you can do with SimDeck

SimDeck packages a full simulator workflow into one cross-tool surface:

- **Stream a Simulator into a browser tab.** Run `simdeck ui --open` and use the same warm project daemon from the browser and CLI.
- **Drive Simulators from JavaScript.** `simdeck/test` can launch apps, tap, wait for accessibility state, batch steps, and capture screenshots.
- **Embed a Simulator in your editor.** The bundled VS Code extension opens the same surface inside a panel.
- **Run Simulators on your LAN.** Bind to `0.0.0.0`, advertise a host, and connect from any other Mac, iPad, or laptop on the network.
- **Replace ad-hoc `simctl` scripts.** A single CLI handles `boot`, `shutdown`, app install/launch, URL opening, pasteboard, logs, screenshots, and UI input.
