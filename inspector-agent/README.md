# Xcode Canvas Inspector Agent

`XcodeCanvasInspectorAgent` is a debug-only iOS framework that an app can link to expose its UIKit view hierarchy over a small network protocol.

It is intended to complement the generic accessibility inspector. Accessibility works for any simulator app; this agent works best for apps you control and can link in DEBUG builds.

## Install

Add this folder as a local Swift Package dependency:

```text
inspector-agent
```

Then link the `XcodeCanvasInspectorAgent` product into your app target for Debug only.

## Start The Agent

Call the initializer early in app startup, guarded by `#if DEBUG`.

```swift
#if DEBUG
import XcodeCanvasInspectorAgent
#endif

@main
struct DemoApp: App {
    init() {
        #if DEBUG
        try? XcodeCanvasInspectorAgent.shared.start()
        #endif
    }

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}
```

UIKit apps can do the same from `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`.

```swift
#if DEBUG
try? XcodeCanvasInspectorAgent.shared.start()
#endif
```

The default server starts at TCP `127.0.0.1:47370`. If that port is already used by another simulator app, it automatically tries the next 32 ports and listens on the first free one. It also advertises Bonjour service type `_xcwinspector._tcp`.

## Query It

The protocol is newline-delimited JSON over TCP.

```sh
printf '{"id":1,"method":"Inspector.getInfo"}\n' | nc 127.0.0.1 47370
printf '{"id":2,"method":"View.getHierarchy","params":{"maxDepth":4}}\n' | nc 127.0.0.1 47370
```

When multiple apps with the inspector are running, probe `47370-47402` and use
`Inspector.getInfo.processIdentifier` to link the response to the selected
simulator process.

See `PROTOCOL.md` for the full method list.

## SwiftUI

The agent automatically reports SwiftUI hosting/bridge UIViews. SwiftUI's value tree is not publicly enumerable, so meaningful SwiftUI nodes should be tagged in source:

```swift
Text("Continue")
    .xcwInspectorTag("continue-label", id: "onboarding.continue.label")
```

The tag is represented by a lightweight, non-interactive probe view in the UIKit hierarchy.

## App Framework Hierarchies

Frameworks with their own logical tree can publish that tree into the agent. When a published snapshot exists, `View.getHierarchy` returns it by default; pass `"source": "uikit"` to force the raw UIKit tree.

```swift
try? XcodeCanvasInspectorAgent.shared.publishHierarchySnapshot(
    source: "nativescript",
    snapshotJSON: #"{"source":"nativescript","roots":[]}"#
)
```

This is how the NativeScript integration exposes NativeScript `View` nodes instead of only the backing UIKit views.

Framework snapshots can attach source locations to individual nodes:

```json
{
  "type": "Label",
  "sourceLocation": {
    "file": "src/app/home.component.html",
    "line": 12,
    "column": 5,
    "offset": 238
  }
}
```

The web inspector shows this in the selected node properties.

## Auth Token

For shared-network simulator sessions, start with a token and require every request to include top-level `token`.

```swift
try? XcodeCanvasInspectorAgent.shared.start(
    configuration: .init(
        port: 47370,
        bindToLocalhostOnly: false,
        authToken: "debug-secret"
    )
)
```
